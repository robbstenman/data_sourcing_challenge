HW6

## Description
There were 3 parts to this assignment. Access the NYT API, access the TMDB API, and merge and clean the data for export. In addition to using APIs, the assignment required becoming familiar with a .env file type. Most of the actions were covered in class and I was able to complete most using information from class activities.  

However, I did have issues with the TMDB API. I tried using ChatGPT, but it was not able to resolve the issue. I ended up adding some code that was probably not necessary as I was trying to fix a problem that didn't exist. With the help of the AskBCS Assistant we were able to pinpoint the issue by adding print statements at various points to find the specific line of code that was creating the problem.

## Assistance
During this assignment I used Tabnine, ChatGPT and most importantly, the AskBCS Learning Assistant.
